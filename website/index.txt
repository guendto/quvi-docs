[[about]]
About
-----

The quvi project parses media stream URLs for Internet applications that
would otherwise have to use adobe flash multimedia platform to access
the media streams. Typical examples of this are different media hosts,
such as YouTube, for videos that utilize this platform to deliver the
media content.

[[q]]

The project consists of the following components:

libquvi-scripts::
  The support scripts written in http://lua.org[Lua] that 'libquvi(3)'
  calls to parse the media stream properties.

libquvi::
  The library with the C API for parsing the media stream properties.

quvi::
  The 'silly suite to access the flash media stream properties'. It
  contains the 'quvi(1)' command line tool.

This project does not aim to provide a working alternative to the flash
technology but attempts to work around the flash technology.  See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#Alternatives[here] for
available alternatives.

Why not adobe flash?
