[[about]]
About
-----

The quvi project parses media stream URLs for Internet applications that
would otherwise have to use adobe flash multimedia platform to access
the media streams. Typical examples of this are different media hosts,
such as YouTube, for videos that utilize this platform to deliver the
media content.

[[q]]

The project consists of the following components:

libquvi-scripts::
  The support scripts written in http://lua.org[Lua] that 'libquvi(3)'
  calls to parse the media stream properties.

libquvi::
  The library with the C API for parsing the media stream properties.

quvi::
  The 'silly suite to access the flash media stream properties'. It
  contains the 'quvi(1)' command line tool.

This project does not aim to provide a working alternative to the flash
technology but attempts to work around the flash technology.  See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash#Alternatives[here] for
available alternatives.

Why not adobe flash?

Status
~~~~~~

Current::
  0.4 is the current stable. 0.9 is the current unstable.

Long-term goals::
  Maintain the 0.4 series. Develop the 0.9 series which will ultimately
  graduate as the next stable (1.0) replacing the 0.4 series.

------------------------

=== Stable (0.4)

The 0.4 is the 'current stable' series.  The series is now in the
'maintenance mode' -- the development has ceased -- and will only have
'maintenance releases' from time to time.

=== Unstable (0.9)

The 0.9 series is currently _under development_, and will gradually
mature as the next stable (1.0), replacing the 0.4 series completely.

The series may still see:

  * ABI and API breakages with the earlier 0.9 versions
  * Feature additions and/or removals

The 0.9 series is incompatible with the 0.4 series -- see
<<doc,Documentation>> and 'quvi-prj-ptnine(7)' for an overview

TIP: For building instructions, see the 'HOWTOs' section of the
     <<doc,Documentation>>
