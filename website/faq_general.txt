include::shared/license.txt[]

[[os]]
=== Which operating systems does (lib)quvi run on?

Linux and BSD (supported by the upstream). Other ports may exist, none
of which we (the upstream) do not directly support.

[[whynotall]]
=== Why cannot the project support all flash based video websites?

Most media hosting websites are technically very different. Our aim is
to _work around_ the adobe flash requirement *not enable it*. This means
that the quvi project cannot execute the flash object and follow the
links but, instead, another way needs to be found in order to work
around the flash.

The typical solution is to parse the required properties and put
together the URL to the media stream.
