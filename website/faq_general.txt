=== How is the quvi project licensed?

include::shared/license.txt[]

[[os]]
=== Which operating systems does (lib)quvi run on?

GNU/Linux and BSD (supported by the upstream). Other ports may exist, none
of which the upstream directly supports.

[[whynotall]]
=== Why cannot the project support all flash based video websites?

Most media hosting websites are technically very different. Our aim is
to _work around_ the adobe flash requirement, *not enable it*.

This means that the project cannot simply just execute the flash object
code and follow the links, but find another way to access the media
streams. The typical solution is to parse the required properties and
then put together the media stream URLs from those.
